Here is my favorite cat, Peppers. 

She had her 11th birthday last month and I helped make her a "cat cake" for her out of wet food, carrots, and bit of shrimp. 
Peppers has a daughter named "Cow" and they like taking afternoon naps together. They also get into plenty of trouble together, just a bit ago they knocked over a jar of catnip the other day and had themselves a little party.
